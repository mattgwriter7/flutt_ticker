# flutt_ticker version 1.07
This is a super-simple meeting timer.  (For detailed notes see [NOTES.md](./NOTES.md) )

I have a Youtube demo, and even explain things as I walk through it:

## LEFT OFF
* added launcher icon
* added clock seconds tick
* formatted time (after 90 min)
* added wakelock pkg
* forced portrait

## NEXT
* ?

## FUTURE
* monospaced font?       
* add some logic for state change (when other apps sorce suspension)

## CONSIDERATIONS
* should I outline start button in thin green keyline (to give it a little pop?)
* should I add any effects or animations? (I think no -- keep it simple)
* add mechanism to show only time/date?
    + like a longpress of time/date hides timer and button?
* add splash screen?
* add intro screen or onboarding?
* make it responsive for bigger screens?
    + make fonts and button bigger
