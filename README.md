# flutt_ticker version 1.02
This is a super-simple meeting timer.  (For detailed notes see [NOTES.md](./NOTES.md) )

## LEFT OFF
* changed colors
* added HUD (for quitting, resetting)
* forced portrait

## NEXT
* ?

## FUTURE
* smooth it out so it doesn't "jump" when timer starts
    + making seconds "00" in black to start will do the trick...
    + cancel and reset Timer interval, too
* monospaced font?       
* remove leading "0" is time is < 10 
* add some logic for state change (when other apps sorce suspension)

## CONSIDERATIONS
* should I outline start button in thin green keyline (to give it a little pop?)
* should I add any effects or animations? (I think no -- keep it simple)
* add mechanism to show only time/date?
    + like a longpress of time/date hides timer and button?
